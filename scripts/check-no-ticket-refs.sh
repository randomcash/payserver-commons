# Refuses a tracked source file that carries a ticket id or a tracker link.
#
# This repository is public. A ticket id in the source leaks the title and
# shape of unreleased work to anyone reading it, and it is useless to the
# only audience the code has: an outside reader cannot open the tracker to
# make sense of it. The ticket id belongs in the commit message and the PR
# title. Write the reason the code exists, not a pointer to where someone
# once explained it.
#
# git grep, not bare grep: grep on this box is ugrep and honours
# .gitignore, which has already produced a false-clean leak scan.

# every nonzero exit into "clean" would reproduce, one layer up, the exact
# false-clean-scan failure this check exists to catch.
