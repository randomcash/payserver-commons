//! The webhook event contract: event vocabulary, payload, and idempotency key.
//!
//! This is the wire contract only. Delivery — the queue, the retry schedule,
//! HMAC signing, the sink trait — is a server concern and stays in the server
//! that does the delivering. What lives here is everything a *subscriber*
//! needs: the complete list of events it can receive, the shape of the body it
//! will be handed, and the rule for deduping repeats.
//!
//! # The event vocabulary is a contract
//!
//! [`WebhookEventType`] is the complete list of events a subscriber can ever
//! receive, and every variant of it is emitted by some code path in the
//! server. Adding a variant means wiring an emission in the same change; a
//! variant that nothing can produce is a promise to subscribers that is
//! silently never kept.
//!
//! # Delivery is at-least-once
//!
//! A queued job is retried on any non-2xx response or transport error, and the
//! queue is one a worker reads from and then removes the job. A subscriber
//! that returns 2xx after a network failure, or a handler that re-runs after
//! the server restarts mid-transition, will therefore see the same logical
//! event more than once. There is no at-most-once mode and no ordering
//! guarantee between events for different invoices.
//!
//! Subscribers must be idempotent. Every payload carries
//! [`WebhookPayload::idempotency_key`], derived from the event's identity
//! rather than from a random id or a send-time clock, so the same logical
//! event always carries the same key: record the keys you have processed and
//! drop repeats. It is also sent as the `X-Webhook-Idempotency-Key` header, so
//! a subscriber can dedupe before parsing the body.
//!
//! `event_id` is *not* that key — it identifies one queued delivery and a
//! re-emission of the same logical event gets a fresh one.
//!
//! # Payload compatibility
//!
//! Payloads carry an explicit [`WEBHOOK_PAYLOAD_VERSION`] in the `version`
//! field. The rule is **additive-only**:
//!
//! - New fields may be added at any time without bumping the version.
//!   Subscribers must ignore fields they do not recognise.
//! - New [`WebhookEventType`] variants may be added without bumping the
//!   version. Subscribers must ignore event types they do not recognise
//!   rather than failing the delivery.
//! - Removing a field, renaming one, changing its type, or changing the
//!   meaning of an existing value is a breaking change and requires a version
//!   bump.
//!
//! Optional fields are omitted rather than sent as `null` or as a placeholder
//! value; absent means "does not apply to this event", not "unknown".
