//! Instantiate a plugin module, call an export, bound it with a deadline,
//! and turn whatever goes wrong into a value instead of a panic.
//!
//! The calling convention is host-defined, not part of
//! `payserver-plugin-api` yet: a plugin exports `memory`, an
//! `alloc(len: i32) -> i32` bump allocator the host uses to place its (JSON)
//! argument, and one function per call name with signature
//! `(ptr: i32, len: i32) -> i64`, the result packed as `(ptr << 32) | len`
//! into the return value.
//!
//! # Calling back into the host
//!
//! A plugin used to be a pure function: it received bytes and returned bytes,
//! and could ask the host nothing. That is enough for a filter whose answer
//! depends only on its argument and nothing else — and not enough for any
//! plugin that has state, because it could not read its own tables.
//!
//! Imports are supplied under the module name [`HOST_MODULE`], and every one
//! is always defined whether or not this host can actually service it. A
//! plugin that imports a function the host does not provide fails at
//! *instantiation*, which would turn "this host cannot do storage" into "this
//! plugin will not load", losing the difference between a plugin that is
//! broken and a host that is minimal. Unbacked imports answer with an error
//! instead.
//!
//! The answer is passed in two steps, and the reason is worth stating because
//! the one-step version looks simpler:
//!
//! 1. `storage_query(ptr, len) -> i64` runs the request and returns the
//!    length of its answer, or a negative value on failure.
//! 2. `host_take(ptr, len) -> i32` copies that answer into a buffer the
//!    plugin has since allocated for itself.
//!
//! One step would mean the host allocating inside the plugin's memory, which
//! means calling the plugin's own `alloc` export from inside a host function
//! that the plugin called — re-entering an instance mid-call. Two steps keep
//! the host writing only into memory the plugin already owns.
