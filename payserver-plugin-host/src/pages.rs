//! Host-side page resolution for `GET /plugins/{id}/pages/{path}`.
//!
//! No wasmtime runtime has landed on `main` yet (the runtime and the route
//! mounting that would back a real plugin exist only on other, unmerged
//! branches at the time of writing), so there is no plugin code this host
//! can actually invoke. [`PageRenderer`] is the seam a real plugin will
//! implement once that runtime exists; production wiring starts with an
//! empty [`PageHost`], so every request 404s until a renderer is registered.
//! That is correct behaviour today, not a stub masking a bug - there is
//! nothing to render.
