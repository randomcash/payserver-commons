//! Runs plugins: dispatches actions and filters, bounds every call with a
//! deadline, and disables a plugin after repeated failure — with the reason
//! visible without going anywhere near wasmtime.
//!
//! # Action vs. filter
//!
//! These are two different entry points, not one dispatch call with a flag,
//! because they fail differently:
//!
//! - [`PluginHost::run_action`] is fire-and-forget. It returns nothing, so
//!   there is nothing for a failing action to change; failure is only ever
//!   observable via [`PluginHost::status`].
//! - [`PluginHost::run_filter`] carries the call's deadline and, when the
//!   filter cannot run, resolves to the manifest's declared
//!   [`FailureMode`] — closed unless the manifest said otherwise, per
//!   [`payserver_plugin_api::Manifest`]'s own parse-time default.
//!
//! Neither of these is wired to anything that touches payment detection,
//! crediting or confirmation, and nothing in this module could be: the only
//! hook points that exist are the generic `run_action`/`run_filter` calls
//! above, keyed by a plugin-supplied export name chosen by whoever adds the
//! next call site. The money-path hook points this must never become
//! belong to a future, host-API-surface ticket — this slice adds no hook
//! points of its own at all.
//!
//! # Why the admin surface survives a crash loop
//!
//! [`PluginHost::status`] never touches the [`std::sync::Mutex`] guarding a
//! plugin's wasmtime instance. It reads two atomics and, at most, a small
//! `RwLock<String>` holding the disabled reason — none of which a stuck or
//! looping call ever holds while blocked inside wasm. And once a plugin is
//! disabled, `run_action`/`run_filter` stop calling into wasmtime for it at
//! all, so a crash loop is bounded to `max_failures` attempts, not
//! unbounded.
