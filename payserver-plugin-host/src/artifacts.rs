//! Where a plugin's wasm lives on disk, and what makes it the same wasm that
//! was installed.
//!
//! A plugin is code this server compiles and runs. The artifact directory is
//! writable by whoever administers the box, and on a containerised install it
//! is a mounted volume - so "the file at the path we recorded" and "the file
//! we accepted at install" are not the same claim. The digest is what makes
//! them one: it is taken over the bytes at install, stored next to the
//! install record, and re-checked before the module is handed to wasmtime on
//! every boot.
//!
//! That check is not a security boundary against an admin with disk access -
//! nothing here could be. It is what turns a swapped, truncated or
//! half-written artifact into a refusal with a reason instead of arbitrary
//! code, which is the failure mode that actually happens: an interrupted
//! copy, a restored volume snapshot, a half-finished manual upgrade.
